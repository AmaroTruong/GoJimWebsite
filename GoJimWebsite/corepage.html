                <li>Remember to breathe normally throughout the exercise, taking deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.</li>
                <li>To make the exercise more challenging, try lifting one leg off the ground or alternating between lifting your left and right arms off the ground.</li>
                <li>Repeat for several sets, with rests in between.</li>

        <img class="image" src="https://www.inspireusafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tuck-crunch.gif">
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground.</li>
                <li>Place your hands behind your head, with your elbows pointing outwards.</li>
                <li>Lift your shoulders and upper back off the ground, and bring your knees towards your chest at the same time.</li>
                              <li>At the top of the movement, your elbows should touch your knees or be as close as possible.</li>
                <li>Squeeze your abs and hold the position briefly.</li>
                <li>Lower your shoulders and legs back down to the starting position, but do not let your head touch the ground between repetitions.</li>
                <li>Repeat the movement for the desired number of reps, keeping your form and technique consistent throughout the exercise.</li>
                <li>Variation: To make the exercise more challenging, you can try holding a weight plate or a medicine ball between your feet as you perform the tuck crunch.</li>

        <h2>Cable Crunch</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://www.inspireusafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cable-crunch-1536x915.png">
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Set up the cable machine: Attach a rope or handle to the high pulley on a cable machine and adjust the weight to a comfortable level.</li>
                <li>Kneel in front of the cable machine facing away from the machine, and grab the handle or rope with both hands, holding it at the sides of your head.</li>
                <li>Keeping your elbows pointing forward, slowly crunch your torso downwards, squeezing your abs and bringing your chest towards your knees.</li>
                <li>Hold the crunch for a few seconds, then slowly release back to the starting position.</li>
                <li>Repeat for the desired number of reps.</li>
                <li>Focus on using your abs to perform the crunch, rather than pulling with your arms or neck.</li>
                <li>Exhale as you crunch downwards, and inhale as you release back to the starting position.</li>
                <li>Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid using momentum to perform the exercise.</li>
                <li>Vary the weight and reps to suit your fitness level and goals.</li>
                <li>If you experience any pain or discomfort while performing the exercise, stop immediately and consult with a fitness professional.</li>

        <h2>Leg Raises</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://www.inspireusafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hanging-leg-raise-movement.gif">
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find a sturdy pull-up bar or other hanging apparatus to hang from.</li>
                <li>Reach up and grip the bar with an overhand grip, with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.</li>
                <li>Engage your core and lift your legs up towards the bar, keeping them straight and your toes pointed.</li>
                <li>Once your legs reach the bar, pause briefly and squeeze your abs and hip flexors to fully engage the muscles.</li>
                <li>Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position, keeping your core engaged and your movements controlled.</li>
                <li>Repeat the movement for the desired number of reps, keeping your form and technique consistent throughout the exercise.</li>
                <li>If you're having trouble keeping your legs straight, try bending your knees slightly to make the movement easier.</li>
                <li>If you're finding the exercise too easy, try adding ankle weights or holding a
dumbbell between your feet to increase the resistance.</li>
