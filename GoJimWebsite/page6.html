    <p>If you're new to strength training, start with bodyweight exercises, such as push-ups, pull-ups, and dips, to build a foundation of strength. Compound exercises, such as push-ups, pull-ups, and bench presses, work multiple muscle groups at once, helping you build overall strength. As you get stronger, incorporate weight training into your routine. Use dumbbells, barbells, or resistance bands to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth. When strength training, it's important to use proper form to prevent injuries and maximize results. Focus on good posture, engage your core muscles, and use a full range of motion. Give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts. Aim for 1-2 days of rest between upper body strength training sessions. Consistency is key to building strength. Aim for 2-3 strength training sessions per week, and gradually increase the weight or intensity over time.</p>
