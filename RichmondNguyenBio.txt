My name is Richmond Nguyen and I am a first-year student at Drexel who is 
majoring in Software Engineering. Some of my current projects include 
a stocks discord bot, a finance tracking webapp, and a personal portfolio 
website. With my newfound knowledge, I hope to apply my programming skills and make 
a positive difference in the world.
